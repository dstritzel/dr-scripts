# 4 Magics: Attunement, Arcana, Utility, Augmentation
# 3 Weapons (only 2 are needed to circle): Brawling, Heavy Thrown, Large Blunt
# 2 Armors (only 1 is needed to circle): Light Armor, Shield Usage
# 4 Survivals: Perception, Outdoorsmanship, Athletics, Stealth
# 3 Lores: Appraisal, Tactics, Scholarship (Does not include Performance or Bardic Lore)

# Eventually you will need to train 1 more Magic to circle (for a total of 5)
# However, you will probably end up training them all since they each have very useful spells
